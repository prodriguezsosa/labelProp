# Stop

**labelProp** is under construction, which means it may change significantly in the coming weeks. That said, feel free to make suggestions (use Issues), happy to add co-authors/contributors.

# About

**labelProp** provides a semi-supervised approach to labeling text data, leveraging vector representations of text and network methods. The general problem that **labelProp** solves is the following: given a collection of nodes --these can be words, short texts etc.-- for which we have vector representations --importantly, on the same vector space--, including a small subset for which we have labels --called seeds--, how do we determine the labels of the remaining set of nodes?
